#React 
--------

## Components
When using Render method, the first argument is the component you would like to render, and the second is the DOM node it should mount to. You can use `createClass` method to customize component classes. It takes an object of specifications as an argument.

```js
var MyComponent = React.createClass({
    render: function(){
        return (
            <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        );
    }
});

```

Then render it out like below:

```js
React.render(
    <MyComponent />,
    document.getElementById('myDiv')
)
```

## Props
Once you define components as above, you can add attributes, which are called props. These attributes are available in your component as `this.props`, which can be used in your render method to render dynamic data:

```js
var MyComponent = React.createClass({
    render: function(){
        return (
            <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>
        );
    }
});

React.render(<MyComponent name="Handsome" />, document.getElementById('myDiv'));
```

## Specs, Lifecycle & State
You can create a component only by `render` method. However, there are other helpful methods such as spec and lifecyle that can help you interact with the component in many possible ways.

### Lifecycle Methods

+ **componentWillMount** : Invoked once, on both client & server before rendering occurs.
+ **componentDidMount**: Invoked once, only on the client, after rendering occurs.
+ **shouldComponentUpdate**: Return value determines whether component should update.
+ **componentWillUnmount**: Invoked prior to unmounting component.

### Specs

+ **getInitialState**: Return value is the initial value for state.
+ **getDefaultProps**: Sets fallback props value if props aren't supplied.
+ **mixins**:  An array of objects, used to extend the current component's functionality.
    
### State
Every component may have a state object, and a props (Read more about differency between `props` and `state` [here](https://github.com/uberVU/react-guide/blob/master/props-vs-state.md)). Calling `setState` triggers UI updates, which is the bread and butter of React's interactivity. (In my opinion, this is the point that differentiates React with others). If you would like to set an initial state before any interaction occurs, use the `getInitialState` method.

```js
var MyComponent = React.createClass({
    getInitialState: function(){
        return {
            count: 5
        }
    },
    render: function(){
        return (
            <h1>{this.state.count}</h1>
        )
    }
});
```

##Events
React also has a built-in cross browser events system. The events are attached as properties of components, and can trigger methods. Letâ€™s try increasing the count by using events with below example.

```js
var Counter = React.createClass({
  incrementCount: function(){
    this.setState({
      count: this.state.count + 1
    });
  },
  getInitialState: function(){
     return {
       count: 0
     }
  },
  render: function(){
    return (
      <div class="my-component">
        <h1>Count: {this.state.count}</h1>
        <button type="button" onClick={this.incrementCount}>Increment</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
});

React.render(<Counter/>, document.getElementById('mount-point'));
```


## Unidirectional Data Flow
In React, application data flows unidirectional via the `state` and `props` objects, as opposed to the two-way binding of libraries like Angular. This means that in a multi component heriachy, a common parent component should manage the `state`, and pass it down the chain via `props`.

With `setState` method, state update will lead to UI update. Keep that in mind when you use the method. The resulting values should be passed down to child components using attributes, which are accessible in said children via `this.props`.

```js
var FilteredList = React.createClass({
  filterList: function(event){
    var updatedList = this.state.initialItems;
    updatedList = updatedList.filter(function(item){
      return item.toLowerCase().search(
        event.target.value.toLowerCase()) !== -1;
    });
    this.setState({items: updatedList});
  },
  getInitialState: function(){
     return {
       initialItems: [
         "Apples",
         "Broccoli",
         "Chicken",
         "Duck",
         "Eggs",
         "Fish",
         "Granola",
         "Hash Browns"
       ],
       items: []
     }
  },
  componentWillMount: function(){
    this.setState({items: this.state.initialItems})
  },
  render: function(){
    return (
      <div className="filter-list">
        <input type="text" placeholder="Search" onChange={this.filterList}/>
      <List items={this.state.items}/>
      </div>
    );
  }
});

var List = React.createClass({
  render: function(){
    return (
      <ul>
      {
        this.props.items.map(function(item) {
          return <li key={item}>{item}</li>
        })
       }
      </ul>
    )  
  }
});

React.render(<FilteredList/>, document.getElementById('mount-point'));
```
